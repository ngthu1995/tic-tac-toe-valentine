Declaring a variable with var in your for loop doesn’t limit its scope to just that block of code like it would using let. Since its existence extends beyond that for loop, when the value is evaluated by the setTimeout() callback, you get the last value it was set to. (it gets set to 10, which is why the for loop stops)\" ]\n    // },\n    // {\n    //     question: 'What will this code print?',\n    //     img: js9,\n    //     answer: [\n    //         'true',\n    //         'false',\n    //         'The first statement returns true.',\n    //         'The second returns false because of how the engine works regarding operator associativity for < and >.
